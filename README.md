Project Description
===================
ResEx is the composite, translation friendly .NET Resource editor.

This project was initiated by Dimitris Papadimitriou on 2007 and it was made available on CodePlex on 2009.
I, Sebastian Baumhekel, forked it at GitHub, to include my patches and the latest patches of others.
The main reason was to move the project forward even though unfortunately the author did his last commit in 2011.

Features
--------
Here is what you can do with ResEx:
* Translate values side by side (just like the old time classic VB6 resource editor)
* Lock specific strings so that translator does not translate them
* Restrict length of translating strings
* Ensure correct translation of strings with placeholders {0} {1} ...
* Warnings about shortcut characters (string containing &)
* View resource strings in tree form
* Translate resources without Visual Studio IDE
* Search inside resource files while translating
* Word Count to help estimation of translation cost
* Compatible with both Visual Studio 2005 and 2008
