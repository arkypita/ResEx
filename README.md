= Project Description =
ResEx is the composite, translation friendly .NET Resource editor.

This project was initiated by Dimitris Papadimitriou on 2007 and it was made available on CodePlex on 2009.
I, Sebastian Baumhekel, forked it at GitHub, to include my patches and the patches of others.
The main reason was to move the project forward even though the author did his last commit in 2011.

= Why you need it =

Come ye, therefore, let us go down, and there confound their tongue, that they may not understand one another's speech. And so the Lord scattered them from that place into all lands, and they ceased to build the city. And therefore the name thereof was called Babel (confusion), because there the language of the whole earth was confounded: and from thence the Lord scattered them abroad upon the face of all countries.
Genesis 11:7-9
